# helloworld

My name is jie, and I am currently an 3rd year undergraduate student at McGill university majoring in computer science. For this semester, I am studying databse, intro to C++, and website development. The programming language that I am most skilled is Java; however, I prefer programming in python. It is much cleaner and simpler, and many useful built-in functions are there.
